The Click2Mail API tool is a standalone interface and .NET library for both developers and standard users.  The tool was developed to allow for quickly parsing and mailing of PDF’s that contain multiple mailers in a single PDF with dynamic page content.  The process will streamlines mailing to the intended recipient documents such as Invoices, Newsletters, Account Statements, or any other document generated from standard reporting tools such as Crystal Reports, SSRS , and others.  As long as an address block exists on a PDF the software will quickly parse based on simple settings.  Post parsing the document automatically the appropriate mailers are transmitted to the Click2Mails API and verified received properly.
In addition to the parsing features, Click2Mail API Tool also allows for sending any single document to addresses on an Excel list from within the software very quickly utilizing easily defined templates.  By utilizing a built in template based system virtually any type of mass mailing with PDF documents can be streamlined. 
If you use the library as a .net plug in, you can build all the features into your CRM or other .net Solution to automate any type of mailer.  The mailer will generate in a controlled way and results can be dump to any database or log files easily from the calling solution.  The goal of this is to make any mailer have virtually no user intervention required besides initiating a button click.
