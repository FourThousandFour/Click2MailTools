The Public API Tool for Click2Mail? (PATC) is a free, open source application and software toolkit created specifically for clients of Click2Mail. The PATC was developed to enable speedy parsing and mailing of PDFs. Specifically, multi-recipient PDFs which can contain multiple, variable length documents combined in a single PDF with dynamic page content. The tool also automates the mailing of a single PDF document to multiple recipients on an Excel list.
Intended for non-technical users as well as developers, PATC is both a standalone interface and a .NET library. PATC streamlines and fully automates the Click2Mail submission process for business documents such as invoices, statements of account, newsletters and other documents generated from standard reporting tools such as Crystal Reports and SSRS. Developers can use the library as a .net plug in and build all the PATC features into a CRM or other .net solution to automate almost any type of mailer. When integrated into an existing solution, no user intervention beyond a button click is typically required.
The software can scan an address block area on a PDF and, based on simple settings, quickly parse the individual addresses on multiple, variable-page documents. Post parsing, each document is tagged with its matching recipient data. PATC generates the mailers in a controlled way and results can be easily dumped to any database or log file from the calling solution. PATC then transmits the mailers via the Click2Mail API and files are verified by Click2Mail as properly received.
In addition to the parsing feature, PATC also provides easily defined templates within the software, enabling users to quickly mail any single document to multiple addresses on an Excel list.  With this built-in template-based system, Click2Mail clients can streamline virtually any type of mass mailing using PDF documents.
